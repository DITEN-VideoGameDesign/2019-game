# Video Game Design course - 2019/2020 - Game Project

Introductory game project for Unreal Engine 4.

 **NOTE**: the "*Starter Content*" package is included automatically if not present when the project is loaded in the editor (copying it from your local installation of UE4). So don't modify its content in the project, as changes will be lost.
